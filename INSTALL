Installation notes for the qtbase package
-----------------------------------------

The qtbase package should work on Linux and Mac. Windows support is
still in progress.

Requirements
------------
1. Qt >= 4.0.0 SDK (>= 4.8.0 recommended for optimal performance)
2. cmake >= 2.8.1

Mac OS X instructions
---------------------

1. Make sure that you have a recent version of xcode installed.
2. Install Qt from by downloading and running the installer at
   http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp.
3. Install cmake (version 2.8.1 or later); obtain it from cmake.org.
4. Check your PATH, ensuring that both are visible.
5. Run R CMD INSTALL qtbase.

Windows instructions
--------------------

1. Download the 64 bit MinGW Qt binaries and headers from ...
2. Install cmake >= 2.8.1 from http://www.cmake.org/.
3. Set CMAKE_PATH environment variable to path containing cmake.exe.
4. Set QTBASE_QT_PATH to the directory containing qmake.exe.
5. Set RC_COMPILER to point to windres.exe in R Tools. This path must use the
   '/' file separator, instead of '\'.
6. Make sure that PATH includes perl.exe.
7. Make sure that the machine is properly configured to build binary packages.
8. Using command.exe, run R CMD INSTALL qtbase.

Linux instructions
------------------

1. Install the Qt SDK (i.e., devel) >= 4.0 and cmake >= 2.8.1 packages.
2. R CMD INSTALL qtbase.

Building on Windows
===================

Building qtbase
-----------------------

1. Install Rtools.
2. Install cmake.
3. Download and install the Qt libraries:
   32 bit: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp
   64 bit: follow the instructions below to build it.
3. Set the CMAKE environment variable to point to your cmake.exe.
4. Set QMAKE environment variable to point to qmake.exe.
5. Make sure perl.exe is on your PATH.
6. Set RC_COMPILER environment variable to point to windres.exe from Rtools.
7. Start the command shell.
9. Run "R CMD INSTALL --build qtbase" with "--arch 32" or "--arch 64".

Building Qt for 64 bit
------------------------------

1. Download the latest Qt source code and extract it somewhere.
   URL: (http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.2.zip)
2. The complicated part is getting Qt to build with the compiler from
   Rtools. Open somewhere/mkspecs/win32-g++/qmake.conf and set
   QMAKE_CFLAGS and QMAKE_LFLAGS to "-m64". Also, add "-F pe-x86-64"
   to QMAKE_RC.  In qmake/Makefile.win32-g++-sh, add "-m64" to CFLAGS
   and change LFLAGS in that file to "-s -m64".
3. Start the command shell.
5. Switch to the qt source directory.
6. Run
 "configure -release -opensource -nomake examples -nomake demos -no-qt3support"
7. Run mingw32-make, as instructed.
8. Wait a long time.
